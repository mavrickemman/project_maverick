        <h1>Hello, world.</h1>
        <p class="lead">I am Emman Calabroso. I design simple and usable solutions to problems arising from humans
          interacting with machines. Though I do employ good visual design for this, I go beyond them
          and think in terms of design systems and modules rather than pages and layouts. I
          specialize in a detailed understanding of design in a digital environment and in a
          design process that starts from conception until live production.</p>

        <p>MEDtrip is a comprehensive directory for the medical tourism industry connecting traveling patients with
          clinics and hospitals worldwide. Patients can search the MEDtrip directory of care providers by treatment
          needed and/or travel destination. The site makes it easy to compare medical clinics, certifications, services,
          and educational backgrounds of the doctors. Patients can then connect with doctors at home and abroad. The
          directory helps patients plan for their medical trip from medical visas to local travel arrangements and
          wellness options like spas, therapy, and healing options.</p>

        <p>My task was to first organize the ideas of what we need the application to do, the pain points that it is
          trying to solve and then the immediate goals that we need to achieve. I was tasked to construct a viable and
          scalable product to which we can gradually iterate upon.</p>
        <p>I was responsible for coming up with simple and user-friendly interface based on the user stories that the
          team came up. The process involves wireframes to demonstrate data flow which ranged from simple pen and paper
          sketches to low fidelity design compositions and presentations. I also made high-fidelity mockups of those
          screens and then translated them to usable code for the developers. Codes were shared on a unified repository
          using Git for which both designers and developers can collaborate.</p>

        <p>Spoke Health is a healthcare marketplace which fundamentally changes the way healthcare is provided and paid
          for by insurance companies and self-insured employers. Using a personal concierge service alongside
          state-of-the-art custom technology, Spoke uses predictive analytics to recognize a prospective patient,
          develop a trusting personal relationship with the patient, and then assist the patient through the stressful
          process of selecting the best-fit healthcare option considering variables such as outcome based quality
          metrics, cost, location, and best medical practices. Behind the scenes, Spoke is at the forefront of
          value-based care by defining surgery bundles that span the episode of care, checking real time surgery pricing
          and providing telemed communication systems that integrate seamlessly as a single product.</p>

        <p>The design task was split into two domains: the first is administrative web application that helps employers
          and company owners manage the product and the second was the frontend side to which potential users and
          employees can view and interact with what the system offers. Case studies and intelligent assumptions were
          made to fully customise the experience for the administrative side because that is where the bulk of the
          project is.</p>
        <p>I employed the usual process of sketching, making high fidelity mockups and translating mockups to usable
          code. The mockups were made using the Sketch tool and shared collaboratively on Invision app web application.
          I used Foundation Zurb for the HTML/CSS framework and the stylesheets were maintained using SASS via shared
          Git repository.</p>

        <p>The task was to create an Event Manager platform which spans from managing/creating events, full vehicle
          dispatch and hotel accommodation management to talent/entity management. The challenge was to design a system
          to seamlessly integrate all these functionalities into one platform without overwhelming the user. Interface
          designs were done in paper to Sketch and then translated to code using Foundation Zurb framework. I made sure
